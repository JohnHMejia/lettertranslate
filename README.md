# Transfer Learning to Recognize Letters via the Webcam
INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Open up [the demo](https://johnhmejia.github.io/lettertranslate/)
2. Wait for the mobilenet model to load; if it doesn't within a minute or so, make sure you're using chrome and have a webcam.
3. Add examples of various letters by 


This example shows you how to predict poses from a webcam using transfer learning.

In this example, we're deploying a pretrained [MobileNet](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-examples/tree/master/mobilenet) model and training another model
using an internal mobilenet activation to predict different letters from the webcam defined by the user.
