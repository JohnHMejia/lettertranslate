# Transfer Learning to Recognize Letters via the Webcam
Learn more at https://acehernandez.github.io/2xxtemplate/
This example shows you how to predict poses from a webcam using transfer learning.

In this example, we're deploying a pretrained [MobileNet](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-examples/tree/master/mobilenet) model and training another model
using an internal mobilenet activation to predict different letters from the webcam defined by the user.
